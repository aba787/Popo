# CodeChrono â€“ Time-Based Code Editor

ðŸ§  CodeChrono â€“ The Timeline Code Editor

CodeChrono is an interactive code editor with a sleek dark interface, built to let developers *write, edit, and roll back to any previous code state* using a visual timeline.

This concept is *currently filed as a unique invention*. The core ideaâ€”code editing with timeline navigation and future AI integrationâ€”is original and was born from real-world challenges I personally faced.
